# üêæ Pawkit

Project description:
Pawkit is a full-stack web application designed to help pet owners manage and track their pets‚Äô daily, weekly, and monthly care tasks in one organized place. Whether you‚Äôre caring for one pet or a whole furry family, Pawkit makes it easy to stay on top of feeding, grooming, medications, and more.
